Mass Spec project for CD4 T cells.

I don't have the total experimental design experiment.

It seems to me this is a complicated experiment, but for me 
I will work on the time series data only.


one group

and 4 time points, 5m, 10m, 15m, and 20min.

# Analysis

1) pca  time points to compare changes over time.
2) cluster and group for time series patterns with line figure show patterns

To do, need to run "analysis_CD4+T_0.3.R" to get the data processed first and then go to do PCR pattern, etc.
